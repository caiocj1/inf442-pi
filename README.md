# Minimum Spanning Trees

This project is currently being developped as part of an Ã‰cole Polytechnique course (INF442 - Data Science Algorithms). It explores the properties and uses of minimum spanning trees (MSTs), specially as a basis for clustering algorithms. Finally, we make comparisons between the efficiency of these MST clustering methods and other conventional ones, such as k-means.
